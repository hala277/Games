										<p> It's no surprise that a Call of Duty game will remain one of the most popular video games in 2021. The fact
											that it is an Activision free-to-play video game also helped it attract millions of gamers from all over the world.
											Unlike other battle royale games, Warzone supports battle royale battles with 150 players. As a result, it's exceedingly
											difficult for players to win and defeat all 149 other players. You can play as a solo, a duo, a trio, or a quad
											in Warzone. As a result, there are several alternatives in this respect. If you enjoy multiplayer video games,
											Warzone is one of those PC games that you should check out.</p>

												<p>Minecraft, which was introduced in 2011, is surprisingly one of the most popular video games in 2021. Microsoft
													brought the game out in 2014 because it had so much promise, and it appears that the tech giant was correct.
													Microsoft has over 126 million users as of May 2020, which is a large figure given it is not a free-to-play
													game. If there is a ranking of the most popular games of all time, Minecraft will undoubtedly be among the top
													five. Minecraft allows users to explore a 3D environment and collect raw materials to create any buildings they
													choose. Aside from that, users may engage with other players from all around the world, which is never dull.</p>

												<p>How could we overlook Animal Crossing: New Horizon while discussing popular video games in which you may construct
													things? Animal Crossing: New Horizon is a Nintendo Switch game that allows you to construct whatever you want
													as a villager. New Horizons, like Minecraft, allows participants to interact and explore each other's creations.
													In summary, Animal Crossing: New Horizon allows you to live a dream existence. Animal Crossing: New Horizon
													was launched in March 2020 and received almost 5 million players in less than a month, which is incredible.
													During the COVID-19 lockdown, this video game was also used for virtual marriages, demonstrations, and much
													more.So, Animal Crossing: New Horizon was one of the most popular games of 2020, and in 2021, the game still
													deserves to be on the list.</p>
