						<p> It's no surprise that a Call of Duty game will remain one of the most popular video games in 2021. The fact that
							it is an Activision free-to-play video game also helped it attract millions of gamers from all over the world. Unlike
							other battle royale games, Warzone supports battle royale battles with 150 players. As a result, it's exceedingly
							difficult for players to win and defeat all 149 other players. You can play as a solo, a duo, a trio, or a quad in
							Warzone. As a result, there are several alternatives in this respect. If you enjoy multiplayer video games, Warzone
							is one of those PC games that you should check out.</p>

					<p>Minecraft, which was introduced in 2011, is surprisingly one of the most popular video games in 2021. Microsoft brought
						the game out in 2014 because it had so much promise, and it appears that the tech giant was correct. Microsoft has
						over 126 million users as of May 2020, which is a large figure given it is not a free-to-play game. If there is a ranking
						of the most popular games of all time, Minecraft will undoubtedly be among the top five. Minecraft allows users to
						explore a 3D environment and collect raw materials to create any buildings they choose. Aside from that, users may
						engage with other players from all around the world, which is never dull.</p>

					<p>How could we overlook Animal Crossing: New Horizon while discussing popular video games in which you may construct
						things? Animal Crossing: New Horizon is a Nintendo Switch game that allows you to construct whatever you want as a
						villager. New Horizons, like Minecraft, allows participants to interact and explore each other's creations. In summary,
						Animal Crossing: New Horizon allows you to live a dream existence. Animal Crossing: New Horizon was launched in March
						2020 and received almost 5 million players in less than a month, which is incredible. During the COVID-19 lockdown,
						this video game was also used for virtual marriages, demonstrations, and much more.So, Animal Crossing: New Horizon
						was one of the most popular games of 2020, and in 2021, the game still deserves to be on the list.</p>
